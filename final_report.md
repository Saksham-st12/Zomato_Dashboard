Tirupati, Pune, and Raipur are among the highest-performing cities.

2018 saw peak sales with a slight decline afterward.

ðŸš€ Project Highlights:
Clear visual hierarchy through structured dashboards.

Use of interactive filters (gender, occupation, cuisine, city).

KPI cards for quick summary metrics.

Mix of visual elements: maps, bar charts, donut charts, line charts.

ðŸ’¡ Personal Learning Outcomes:
